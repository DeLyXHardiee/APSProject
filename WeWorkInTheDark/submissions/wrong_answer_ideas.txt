- Also printing for "Kill" and "Reinforcement" queries
- Ignoring the input coordinates of the guards and simply outputting the total number
  of guards in the area for every "EagleVision" query.
- Counting guards outside the range (kinda the same maybe?)
- Not updating guard counts
- Miscalculating the range of Ezio's eagle-vision, such as considering a square
  instead of a circular range.
- Incorrect coordinate system, something that is different from the given zero-indexed
  system.
- Solution which is too slow. Not using a multidimensional Fenwick tree
